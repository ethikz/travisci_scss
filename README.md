Travis CI SCSS Lint Integration
=============
With the integration of Travis CI for deploying apps one thing I noticed was missing.  The lack of Front End tasks in deployments.  

Sure it's main purpose I guess is for the tests to make sure the application itself passes the tests but it's nice as well to make sure apps adhere to style guidelines.
This way in case someone doesn't run a linter or follow the guidelines whether it be a Front End or Back End developer we can prevent the app from successfully building to ensure quality.
